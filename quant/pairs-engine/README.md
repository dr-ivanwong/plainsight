# pairs-engine

The Plainsight pairs sleeve's quant engine. The build contract is [the pairs research integration plan](../../docs/plan/2026-07-22-pairs-research-integration.md); the language decision is [ADR 0005](../../docs/adr/0005-python-for-the-quant-engine.md). The division of labour is one sentence: this package computes and writes artefacts; the app renders them, never trades, and never writes sleeve data. Nothing here is imported by any serving path.

## What exists (slice 1)

- **Data module**: end-of-day adjusted closes for the audited fifty-ticker ASX universe (audited 2026-07-22 against the ASX listed-companies directory; re-run that audit after any gap), cached one CSV per ticker. The refresh rule is whole-window replacement, never append: adjustment factors move on every ex-dividend date, and an appended raw close silently mixes two series.
- **Research module**: the Engle-Granger scan over every pair, on the frozen training window only. The final fifth of the calendar is the holdout; it stays untouched until the backtest's validation step and is used exactly once. Hedge ratio by ordinary least squares on the same window; half-life from the lagged-spread regression with the pairs plan's validity band. The candidate gate is stricter than nominal significance: significance, a valid half-life inside the tradeable band, and a positive hedge ratio.
- **Signals module** (slice 4): the position rule as one code path, entry, exit band, z-stop, time stop and stand-down, consumed by the backtest over history and by the live jobs when their slice lands. Splitting that arithmetic is the live-trades-a-different-strategy risk the plan warns against.
- **Backtest module** (slice 4): the plan's Week 3 engine and Week 4 holdout, verbatim in accounting: dollar P&L per spread unit, costs per side on the gross notional of every entry and exit, borrow on the short leg, metrics off the dollar equity curve. The holdout warm-starts with the last lookback days of training, scores only true holdout days, and is spent once.
- **The artefacts**: versioned camelCase JSON, one report kind per file (`pair-scan-<runDate>.json`, `backtest-<runDate>.json`), mirrored by the Zod schemas in `packages/api-contract` and byte-pinned to the committed golden fixtures.

The live jobs are later slices of the contract's staging, deliberately absent here.

## Commands

From this directory, with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

The first live fetch and scan (the vendor key lives in the environment only, never in a file):

```
EODHD_API_KEY=... uv run pairs-engine fetch
uv run pairs-engine scan
uv run pairs-engine backtest
```

`fetch` refreshes the whole five-year window for all fifty tickers and aborts loudly, all failures listed, if any ticker is missing: a downloader that skips failures quietly shrinks the universe. `scan` reads the cache, freezes the split, runs the statistics, and writes `artefacts/pair-scan-<runDate>.json`. Both `data/` and `artefacts/` are operator-local working state, ignored by git.

Publishing to the app's API (slice 2) rides the same environment-only rule: `PLAINSIGHT_API_URL`, `PLAINSIGHT_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` and `PLAINSIGHT_COGNITO_REFRESH_TOKEN`, then `uv run pairs-engine publish`. The refresh token is minted once via the runbook's pairs publish step; the PUT is idempotent by run date, and artefacts travel in this direction only (the app renders and never writes sleeve data).

## Determinism and tests

Same cached closes, same statistics, byte for byte; `generatedAt` is the only field that moves between reruns over the same inputs. The suite plants what it asserts: a synthetic cointegrated pair with a known hedge ratio and mean-reversion speed that the scan must recover, independent walks that must never become candidates, a hand-computed least-squares fit, and an end-to-end scan whose tested-plus-skipped counts reconcile exactly. Seeded throughout; no network anywhere in the tests.

## Licensing

The EOD data plan is personal-use; its terms, the tripwires at any scale-up, and the vendor pricing live in the pairs trading plan (Week 1, data licensing). Nothing in this package redistributes vendor data: artefacts carry derived statistics, and the raw close cache never leaves the operator's machine in this slice.
