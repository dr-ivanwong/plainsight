"""The write side of the contract mirror.

The committed fixture in packages/api-contract is parsed by the Zod
schemas over there; this test pins the engine's serialisation to the
same bytes. Either side drifting fails a suite, never a render. After
an intended schema change, regenerate per the pairs_engine.golden
docstring and land both sides with the fixture in one commit.
