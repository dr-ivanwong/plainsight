# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

**Plainsight**, a value-investing financial statement analyser: a **single-user, local-first PWA** that computes 12 dashboard metrics from a pinned 14-metric dictionary (margins, ROE/ROIC, leverage, FCF, valuation) from entered or imported financial statements, with deterministic red-flag rules and a structured thesis editor. (Recorded decision, plan §12.7: the name, all repo copy, and the in-app education layer avoid naming any living investor; keep it that way in code, copy, and docs. The educational layer is called the **"Owner's lens."**)

**Current state: live since 2026-07-18, with Phase 3 code-complete the same day: the single-seat Cognito pool, the sync protocol end to end (server routes and the client reconciler with Lamport clocks; two-device convergence proven in tests but deferred: the owner runs one device by decision (main plan §12.15), so that path stays built and tested while a second is not being converged), the BYOK proxy (server half; the client proxy path is pending), and the upload and extraction-job routes. Phase 2.5's bake-off run awaits the owner's provider keys ([docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md)). The source-of-truth migration (main plan §12.9) landed the same day in three slices, and the client reconciler now applies the full (lamport, deviceId) pair comparison of backend spec §4.** The workspace: `packages/calc-engine` (complete per the data-model spec, 100% branch coverage enforced; the golden corpus is ten companies, the US five plus the hand-transcribed ASX five, with the corpus's first naturally fired red flags), `packages/api-contract` (the wire contract as Zod schemas, provenance widened for the ASX MAP source and the extraction reference), `packages/extraction-core` (isomorphic, 100% branch coverage: the provider registry, three SDK-free adapters, the cheap-first escalation walk, the versioned prompt, the PDF preprocessor validated against all seventeen corpus reports, and the bake-off harness in tools/), `apps/api` (the EDGAR mapping held to the golden corpus by integer equality; the ASX side: MAP client with etiquette, statutory-report resolution validated live, the DOC# extract-once cache, the extractFiling Lambda, `.AX` ticker routing, and two-market search; the sync protocol from 2026-07-18: last-write-wins push and checkpointed pull behind the Cognito authoriser, idempotent replays, tombstones with the purge watermark, and append-only thesis version protection; the BYOK proxy and the upload and extraction-job routes the same day, PDF only until the sheet parser lands on both sides), `apps/web` (the offline core: Dexie layer, PWA shell, onboarding, library, dashboard, entry, settings, Journey A green in airplane mode; Journey B imports both markets with extraction provenance intact), `infra/` (seven stacks; invariant, cdk-nag, and snapshot suites; the Phase 2 six deployed to account 679345828813 in `ap-southeast-2` on 2026-07-18 with the deploy jobs armed and the budget and anomaly monitor tag-scoped for the shared account; the Auth pool joined the same day, deployed through the stateful approval gate that was then retired by owner decision (cdk spec §7 as amended), awaiting the owner's account-creation step in the runbook). Outstanding owner actions: confirm the alert email subscription, activate the `project` cost-allocation tag once the first tagged spend appears, then verify both tag-scoped filters against real spend and fire the kill-chain drill (runbook steps 8 to 10), the bake-off run with the four provider keys (then ladder pinning), the review pass over the ASX interpretation notes (calc-engine fixtures README, notes 8 to 31), and the three sector-vocabulary judgement calls (main plan §12 entry 16; data-model spec §12 D3).

### Build and test commands

pnpm runs via corepack (`corepack pnpm ...`); Node 22+. TypeScript is pinned to the 5.9 line (typescript-eslint and parts of the toolchain do not support TS 6/7 yet).

- `corepack pnpm install`, then `corepack pnpm -r typecheck`, `corepack pnpm -r test`, `corepack pnpm -r build` (root scripts fan out to every workspace)
- calc-engine tests enforce 100% branch coverage as a threshold; the golden fixtures regenerate with `EDGAR_CONTACT=you@example.com node tools/generate-fixtures.mjs` (the US five) and `node tools/build-asx-fixture.mjs <csl|wes|wow|jbh|coh>` (the ASX five, from the hand-typed transcriptions in `fixtures/transcriptions/`) from `packages/calc-engine` (read `fixtures/README.md` first: it records the mappings, readings, and the interpretation notes awaiting owner review)
- the provider bake-off runs from `packages/extraction-core` with keys in env only: `node tools/bakeoff.mjs` (see the runbook's Phase 2.5 section)
- infra: `corepack pnpm -C infra synth` and `corepack pnpm -C infra test`; the StaticSite snapshot is reviewed on change, never regenerated blindly
- `node scripts/check-style.mjs` checks every tracked Markdown file; write to the rules the first time

## The plans are the authority

Read the relevant plan before building; each is a contract, not a suggestion:

| Document | Governs |
|---|---|
| [docs/plan/plainsight.md](docs/plan/plainsight.md) | Product scope, design language, frontend/backend/infra architecture, phased roadmap, decision log |
| [docs/plan/plainsight-frontend.md](docs/plan/plainsight-frontend.md) | Every route and screen (S1–S12) with empty/loading/error states, component & hook inventories, folder structure |
| [docs/plan/plainsight-data-model.md](docs/plan/plainsight-data-model.md) | Canonical line items, calc-engine types, policies P-0…P-8, metric dictionary M1–M14, red-flag rules R1–R7, Dexie/export schemas, golden corpus |
| [docs/plan/plainsight-backend.md](docs/plan/plainsight-backend.md) | API contract and error envelope, DynamoDB key design, sync protocol (§4), ingestion, extraction jobs, BYOK proxy |
| [docs/plan/plainsight-cdk.md](docs/plan/plainsight-cdk.md) | CDK stack decomposition, config shape, security invariants as tests, pipelines, cost guardrails |

**Spec status:** the data-model spec is **reviewed and pinned** (owner review pass completed 2026-07-11: D1/D2 resolved, formulas, policies, and rule thresholds confirmed; see its §12). The backend spec is **reviewed and pinned** (owner review pass completed 2026-07-12: sync conflict semantics, error envelope, extraction quota, and proxy sizing confirmed as drafted; see its footer). Calc-engine formulas are buildable as pinned.

Decisions in the plans (see §12 decision log) are **resolved**; do not relitigate them in code. If a decision must change, update the plan in the same change. A decision pass is not done until this file's current-state paragraph agrees with it: the 2026-07-18 passes each left a wake of stale documents that took a review to find (the drift finding of the 2026-07-19 review), and this sentence is that lesson.

**Decision layering:** the skills in [.claude/skills/](.claude/skills/) state general engineering standards (project-agnostic by design); [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) records where this project consciously deviates from them. Check the ADR index before proposing a best-practice addition, because it may already be priced and declined. When new work requires a new deviation, propose an ADR (there's a template) rather than deviating silently.

**House style:** [docs/style.md](docs/style.md) governs all prose in this repo (docs now, UI copy later). Headline rules: no em dashes; AU/UK English spelling (code, US tickers, and company/product names keep theirs); dates as YYYY-MM-DD wherever a specific day is named, in docs and in the app; and **item codes stay in the documents that define them** (main plan §12.8): the plans' letter-number codes (metrics, policies, rules, notes, decisions, screens) and the finding codes reviews and audits mint (BE-1, INFRA-3) never appear in source code, tests, fixtures, or UI copy; write the semantic identifier (`roe`, `erodingMoat`) or the finding in words, and cite the document by section instead. CI enforces all four; run `node scripts/check-style.mjs` locally and write to the rules the first time rather than after the check fails.

## The binding constraint

**The backend is the source of truth (decision §12.9 of the main plan, 2026-07-18, superseding the original local-first constraint).** The authoritative library lives in DynamoDB; the client holds a synchronised working copy in IndexedDB and retries every write until the server accepts it. Offline is a catch-up mode: reads serve the last-synced copy, writes queue and retry, and pending state is surfaced, never silently equal. The migration landed in full on 2026-07-18, three slices: server-wins reconciliation (a pulled server copy beats a dirty local edit; the settings sync row counts the writes still waiting), reads behind the API (the working copy revalidates on launch, reconnect, focus and sign-in; queued writes drain within seconds with backoff; a never-synced device's first read holds placeholder rows rather than claiming an empty library), and the documentation pass (degradation matrix, success criteria, and DR posture rewritten; superseded passages annotated as the history of the offline core). What survives unchanged: nothing in the client serving path may ever call a model, and AI features must degrade to a working app.

## Architecture (decided, not up for debate)

- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces: `apps/web` (React 19 + TypeScript strict, Vite, TanStack Router), `packages/calc-engine`, `packages/extraction-core` (isomorphic: browser + Lambda), `infra/` (CDK).
- **Styling:** Vanilla Extract typed design tokens. Type scale 11/13/15/17/20/22/28/34px, spacing 4/8/12/16/20/24/32/40/48/64px; no freestyle values. `tabular-nums` wherever numbers align. One accent (#007AFF family); green/orange/red reserved for semantic health only.
- **State:** component state plus small hand-rolled `useSyncExternalStore` stores (UI; the plan named Zustand, but nothing yet warranted the dependency and the built shape is recorded here) + TanStack Query (server, Phase 2+); Dexie live queries bind UI to IndexedDB. Zod validates every boundary (form → engine, Dexie → app, API → app).
- **Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright (Chromium and WebKit).

### calc-engine rules (the product's credibility)

- Zero-dependency, pure TypeScript: no React, no DOM, no I/O. `(statements) → MetricsReport`.
- **Money is integer cents (or a decimal library) with explicit currency and unit metadata, never floats.** Formatting is a separate final step.
- Illegal states unrepresentable: incomplete years are typed as such; division-by-zero and negative-equity cases return typed `{ status: 'not_meaningful', reason }`; **NaN must never reach the UI**.
- Test regime: property-based tests (fast-check), golden-file tests against hand-verified filings (US: Apple, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Costco, Union Pacific; ASX: CSL, Wesfarmers, Woolworths, JB Hi-Fi, Cochlear), a regression test per bug found. Target 100% branch coverage on this package.

### Infrastructure rules

- CDK TypeScript in `ap-southeast-2`, single account/environment, default `*.cloudfront.net` origin (no custom domain; `config.domain = null`).
- **Zero VPC**: adding one is a design review, not a default. Secrets only in SSM SecureStrings, referenced by name; never in code, state, or the client bundle.
- Lambdas: `NodejsFunction`, Node 22, ARM64, explicit `timeout` and `logRetention` on every function.
- `cdk-nag` + the invariant assertion tests (cdk spec §6) are CI-blocking; suppressions require inline justification.
- Cost discipline is architectural: consult the not-list (cdk spec §8) before adding any AWS service; most "best practice" additions (WAF, GuardDuty, NAT, Secrets Manager, CloudTrail trail) are deliberately excluded.

## Product discipline

- **12-card budget** (data-model §12 D2): the dictionary pins M1–M14; exactly 12 render as dashboard cards (M10 and M13 live in their siblings' detail sheets); adding a card requires removing or demoting one.
- **Never buy/sell language** anywhere in copy; red flags are "items to investigate," education framing throughout (legal posture, main plan §15).
- Every displayed number must be reproducible by hand from its detail sheet; a number the owner can't trace to inputs is a P0 bug.
- Progressive disclosure: the dashboard stays 12 metrics, their recent years visible on the card faces (the history loosening, main plan §12 entry 14); depth (formula, inputs, Owner's-lens context) stays one tap away.
